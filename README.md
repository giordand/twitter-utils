Twitter Utils for Social Network Analysis. This project is derived from an investigation project in wich the Social Network Twitter was explored to find communities related to Celiac desease. 

Here I share some tools that process tweets and users to generate information and derivated structures such as:
- Friend graphs based on a collection of tweets.
- Download of user timeline.
- Location detection of users based on coordinates or user self description.
- Calculation of user similarity based on classical information retrieval models.
- Conection with database of tweets on a mongodb server
